Developed an interactive memory puzzle game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game requires 
players to memorize and replicate the sequence of the glowing boxes in a 4*4 grid through clicks, with 
the difficulty of the sequence increasing after every round. Ensured optimal layout across devices with 
responsive design. Implemented the game logic to generate a random sequence, track the user clicks 
and calculate score.
